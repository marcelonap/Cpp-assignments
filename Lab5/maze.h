purpose:
This is the header file for the maze_type class

Documentation: Most, if not all the documentation was given. I would
like to point out that there is a typo in the move_backwards() function
documentation. I did not make any changes to this file except these comments.

I was sick while doing this lab but I am confident that I met the requirements.

  maze.h: Provides the maze_type class, which reads a maze from a text file 
    and wanders through it to find the treasure.

  MAZE DESCRIPTION
  
  For long ages, your people have suffered from the oppressive rule of the 
  Iota Surreality. But you have finally stolen their secret weapon, the 
  mythic Division By Zero. Your task now is to enter the Maze of Mad Math 
  and find the Infinite Well, rid the world of the Division By Zero, and 
  escape the maze!

  The maze is made up of a grid of "cells" connected by spaces ("corridors")
  or separated by walls.  The outside edge is all wall, except for a single
  entrance (cell) somewhere along the bottom edge.
  
  It is represented by a 2D array of char's, using the symbols below.  
  (Well, I used a vector of vectors, but it's basically the same thing. :-)  
  
  The current location of the Hero (that's you!) can be described using the
  array indices as coordinates: x for column, y for row.

  The quest is complete when the Hero is at the entrance to the maze after
  finding the Infinite Well.
  
  
  MAZE COORDINATE SYSTEM
  
  The (0,0) point in the maze is the TOP LEFT cell (should be a wall).
  x increases to the right.
  y increases downward.
      So the "up" direction is (0,-1).
  
  
  MAZE SYMBOLS
  The symbols used to represent the maze are stored here as constants.
  (See class definition for the list.)

  
  CONSTRUCTORS:
  (Note: There is NO DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR.  It makes no sense to initialize
  an empty maze.)

  maze_type(const string &maze_filename)
    PRECONDITIONS:  maze_filename is the name of a textfile containing the maze to 
      be explored. 
      The file must include a single entrance character along the bottom edge, and
      include a single Infinite Well (!) somewhere inside.
      The maze should not have any loops.
    POSTCONDITIONS: The contents of the maze file have been loaded into the 
    new maze object, and the Hero has been placed at the entrance, facing up 
    (north).  Flags such as "found the Infinite Well" are set to false.


  ACCESSORS
  
  void show_maze() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Displays the current state of the maze on the screen.
  
  char get_char(int x, int y) const
    PRECONDITIONS: (x,y) is a valid location in the maze.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns the char representing the maze at the given position.

  char get_char(const vector2d& pos) const
    PRECONDITIONS: pos is a valid location in the maze.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns the char representing the maze at the given position.
  
  int get_x() const
  int get_y() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns the x or y coordinate of the Hero's current location.

  vector2d get_pos() const
    POSTCONDITIOSN: Returns the Hero's current location as an (x,y) pair.
  
  vector2d get_facing_dir() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns the direction the Hero is currently facing.
  
  bool facing_wall() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns true if the Hero is facing a wall, or false otherwise.
  
  bool facing_seen() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns true if the Hero is facing a corridor that has already
    been visited, or false otherwise.
    
  bool facing_empty() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns true if the hero is facing an empty corridor that has never been visited.

  bool found_well() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns true if the Hero has found the Infinite Well, or false
    otherwise.
    
  bool at_entrance() const
    POSTCONDITIONS: Returns true if the Hero is at the entrance to the maze,
    or false otherwise.


  MODIFIERS
  
  void face_dir(vector2d dir)
    PRECONDITIONS: dir is a valid direction vector ((0,1) etc)
    POSTCONDITIONS: Rotates the Hero to face the given direction, and updates the Hero's char in the maze.
  
  void turn_left()
    PRECONDITIONS: None.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Rotates the Hero 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and updates the Hero's char in the maze.
      (Note: calling this 4 times should turn in a complete circle.)
  
  void turn_right()
    PRECONDITIONS: None.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Rotates the Hero 90 degrees clockwise, and updates the Hero's char in the maze.
      (Note: calling this 4 times should turn in a complete circle.)
  
  bool move_forward()
    PRECONDITIONS: Not facing out of the maze.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Attempts to move the Hero forward (i.e. in the current direction).  Movement fails if the Hero is facing a wall.  Movement marks the old cell as "seen".  (If the old cell contained the Infinite Well, marks it as "Well Found".)
      If the new cell contains the Infinite Well, sets found to true!
      Returns true if the Hero moves, false if not.


  bool move_forward()
    PRECONDITIONS: Back is not facing out of the maze.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Attempts to move the Hero backward (i.e. opposite the current direction).  Movement fails if the Hero's back is to a wall.  Movement marks the old cell as "seen".  (If the old cell contained the Infinite Well, marks it as "Well Found".)
      If the new cell contains the Infinite Well, sets found to true!
      Returns true if the Hero moves, false if not.


  void explore()
    PRECONDITIONS: None.
    POSTCONDITIONS: Possibly recursive function call!
      After this function is called, one of the following situations is true:
      1. The Hero has FULLY explored the maze in all unvisited directions from the current position, WITHOUT finding the Infinite well, and returned to the place where explore_maze was called from, facing the original direction.  (If the Hero is at a dead end, nothing happens.)  Each spot the Hero explored has been marked as "visited".
      2. The Hero found the Infinite Well (yay!) and returned to the place where explore_maze was called from, facing the original direction.  Each spot the Hero explored has been marked as "visited", EXCEPT that the location of the Infinite Well is marked by a different character.
